# Sorting-DSA
<h1>ðŸ“Š Sorting Algorithms</h1><br>
The Sorting section in this repository includes various algorithms used to arrange elements in a specific order (typically ascending or descending). Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in searching, data processing, and optimization problems.

<h2>âœ… Covered Algorithms:</h2>
<h3>Bubble Sort</h3> â€“ Simple, stable, but inefficient for large data sets (O(nÂ²))<br>

<h3>Selection Sort</h3> â€“ Selects the minimum element and places it in the correct position (O(nÂ²))<br>

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3> â€“ Efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets (O(nÂ²))
